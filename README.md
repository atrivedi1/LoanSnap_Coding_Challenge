Solutions to "Uniform Substring" and "Generate Ordered String" problems.

1) The solution to "Uniform Substring" problem has an O(N + T) runtime where N = number of characters in the input string and T = number of elements in the target array
2) The solution to "Generate Ordered String" has an O(NLogN) runtime. I assumed that I was not allowed to use an out-of-box sorting function, and instead implemented a stable Merge Sort. 

# Installation
1) Run `git clone https://github.com/atrivedi1/LoanSnap_Coding_Challenge.git` in the target directory
2) Run `npm install`
3) Run `npm run test` in root folder
